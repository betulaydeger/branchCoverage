Implement tests to improve the branch coverage. You are given a project that does not have any tests and the test coverage is very low (8%). You are expected to increase the test coverage to 100% by implementing junit tests. You are going to use jacoco to measure the current test coverage numbers. You are also going to use mockito for mocking when needed.
